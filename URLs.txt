Workflows:

Centralized workflow - Similar to SVN - Only one main branch in which development is done.

Feature branch workflow - Develop only in feature branches, main branch will never have broken code.
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

Gitflow workflow - Main & Develop branches, Develop has feature and release branches, Main has hotfix branch.

Forking workflow - Used for open source projects collaboration, Fork repo, push changes, create pull requests.

Trunk based workflow - Short lived branches with few commits, merged frequently to main branch.

Merge:
Fast forward - If branch is linear wrt main branch.
3 way - If branch deviates from main branch.
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge

Rebase:
To make branch linear or To convert 3 way merge into Fast forward merge.
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing
Golden Rule of Rebasing:
Do not rebase main onto feature branch.

Pull requests:
A way to review, change and merge code in a branch.

Cherry pick:
Picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another branch.
